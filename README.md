Ever feeling insecure?? Maybe like your scared of cheating in that game because you think your main IP will be banned like me. I felt super odd about my VPN so I made a semi advanced python tool to check using various methods to check if the HWID or IP has been changed using any software. If it didn't work then a message saying "Banned Spoofer/VPN didn't work" will pop up. To delete these bans go to "Bans.txt" in your C: drive and delete the text or the actual file. Then test again. You'll always feel super secure about using this tester. V1.1 is coming soon with more major detections to make sure your real IP won't get banned from your favorite game while cheating.
